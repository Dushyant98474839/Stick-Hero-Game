    -between flipped Hero and lastPillar. There is a bug. if the hero collides with Pillar while being flipped the game
    terminates, if it restarted then the last pillar still exists and when the hero again dies but this time without
    colliding while flipped and the game is restarted then everything works fine. Pillars get added twice
